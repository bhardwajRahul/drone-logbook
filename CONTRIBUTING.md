# Contributing to Open DroneLog

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Open DroneLog! We welcome meaningful additions that improve the project for the community.

## Before You Start

Before implementing a new feature and opening a pull request, please **open an issue first** to discuss your idea with the maintainer. This helps ensure:

- The feature aligns with the project's scope and vision
- Your effort won't be wasted on something that may not be merged
- We can provide guidance on implementation approach
- Duplicate work is avoided

### How to Propose a Feature

1. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/drone-logbook/issues) to see if your idea has already been discussed
2. Open a new issue describing the feature you'd like to add
3. Wait for feedback from the maintainer before starting implementation
4. Once approved, feel free to submit a pull request

## Custom User Scripts

Looking to extend Open DroneLog with custom functionality? Check out the **[Discussions](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/drone-logbook/discussions)** channel with the `User-Script` tag!

This is a great place to find useful additions without waiting for official feature releases.
