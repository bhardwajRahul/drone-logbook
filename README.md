## Features

- **High-Performance Analytics**: DuckDB-powered analytical queries with automatic downsampling for large datasets - import all your flight logs in one place. Free and open source, zero maintanance cost, no monthly subscription for unlimited number of flight log analysis.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Import DJI flight logs (.txt) and Litchi CSV exports with automatic unit detection (metric/imperial). Litchi flights are auto-tagged for easy identification.
- **Smart Deduplication**: Automatically detects and prevents duplicate flight imports based on drone serial, battery serial, and exact start time match, even when importing the same flight from different export versions.
- **Universally available**: The application can be built locally from source, but for ease of use, standalone binaries are provided for Windows and MacOS - ready to deploy. A Docker image is also available for self-hosted web deployment.
- **Interactive Flight Maps**: MapLibre GL with 3D terrain, satellite toggle, start/end markers, and a deck.gl 3D path overlay - visualize your flight map in 3D interatively. Flight replay with play/pause, seek slider, speed control (0.5x-16x), and a 3D-aware aircraft marker that follows the flight path at altitude. Live telemetry overlay during replay showing height, speed, battery, distance, attitude, and more - synced to the playback position. RC stick input overlay visualizes throttle, rudder, elevator, and aileron inputs with progressive-fill bars during playback.
- **Telemetry Charts**: Height/VPS, speed, battery, attitude, RC signal, GPS satellites, RC uplink/downlink, distance-to-home, and velocity X/Y/Z with synchronized drag-to-zoom across all charts.
- **Local-First**: All data stored locally in a single DuckDB database - No sketchy server upload. No need to even upload in DJI's servers, you can copy the log files locally and process them locally (for log decryption, the key will be sent to DJI's server during import, so you need to be online during the first import of a new log file)
- **Smart Tags**: Automatic flight tagging on import — Night Flight, High Speed, Cold Battery, Low Battery, High Altitude, Long Distance, and more. Offline reverse geocoding adds city, country, and continent tags from takeoff coordinates (no internet needed). Add your own manual tags too. Bulk operations: "Untag filtered" removes tags from all filtered flights, "Bulk tag filtered" adds a manual tag to all filtered flights. Toggle auto-tagging on/off and regenerate tags for all flights from Settings.
- **Filters, Search & Sort**: Date range picker, drone/device filter, battery serial filter, duration/altitude/distance range sliders, tag filter, map area filter, search, and sorting - shared across flight list and overview. Filter inversion to negate selections. Searchable dropdowns with type-to-filter and arrow key navigation.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Up/Down arrows to browse flight list, Enter to select, Escape to close modals. Arrow keys work in all dropdowns.
- **Overview Dashboard**: Aggregate totals, averages, heatmap activity with date range selector, pie-chart breakdowns (by drone, battery, flight duration), flight locations cluster map with geographic filter, and top-flight highlights - all filtered by sidebar selections
- **Battery Health Insights**: Per-battery health bars with inline serial renaming, and per‑minute charge usage history timeline with zoom/scroll
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Set flight and airtime thresholds for batteries and aircraft. Progress bars show usage since last maintenance with color-coded warnings (green → yellow → orange → red). Record maintenance with date picker to reset counters. Multi-select dropdowns for tracking multiple items.
- **Theme & Units**: Light/Dark/System theme and Metric/Imperial units
- **Exports**: Direct CSV, JSON, GPX, and KML export from the flight stats bar
- **FlyCard Generator**: Create shareable 1080x1080 social media images with flight stats overlay, map background with flight path, and branding, perfect for sharing on Instagram or Strava-style posts
- **Backup & Restore**: Export your entire database to a portable backup file and restore it on any instance - works on both desktop and Docker

## Accessing flight log files

### DJI Flight Logs

You first need to collect the DJI flight log files that you can import to this application. This project supports modern DJI log files in the `.txt` format. For DJI fly apps on Android or RC remotes, they are usually in `Internal Storage > Android > data > dji.go.v5 > files > FlightRecord`. For iOS, Connect your iPhone/iPad to a computer, open iTunes/Finder, select the device, go to the "File Sharing" tab, select the DJI app, and copy the "Logs" folder. If you are already using Airdata sync, you can download the original logs files directly from there too. 

You can find more details resources from this simple [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=where+can+i+find+the+DJI+log+files&oq=where+can+i+find+the+DJI+log+files)

### Litchi CSV Exports

Litchi flight logs can be exported as CSV files from the Litchi app. The parser automatically detects whether the export uses metric or imperial units based on the column headers (e.g., `altitude(feet)` vs `altitude(m)`) and converts everything to metric internally. Litchi-imported flights are automatically tagged with "Litchi" for easy filtering.

## Migrating from Airdata?

If you're looking to move away from Airdata but have years of flight logs stored there, you might feel stuck since Airdata doesn't offer a bulk download option. Manually downloading hundreds of flights one by one is tedious and time-consuming.

To solve this, I built [**AirData Flight Log Downloader**](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/airdata-downloader), a free, open-source desktop app that lets you bulk download all your flight logs from Airdata in the original DJI TXT format with just a few clicks.

Simply download the app from the [releases page](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/airdata-downloader/releases), log into your Airdata account, and download all your logs. Then import them directly into Drone Logbook for a seamless migration to a local-first, privacy-respecting flight log solution.

## Setup and installation (Windows/MacOS)

There is no installation step if you want to use the standalone binary builds, just visit the latest [release page](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/drone-logbook/releases), and download the appropriate binary for Windows or MacOS and run them.

> [!TIP]
> Explore the [full manual](/docs/manual.md) if you want to have a comprehensive overview of all the available options and features inside the app. 

### Try the Webapp First (No Installation Required)

Want to quickly test the tool before committing to a full installation? Try the hosted webapp. Please only use it for evaluation and temporary visit. 

<a href="https://app.opendronelog.com">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch-Webapp-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=globe" alt="Launch Webapp" height="48"/>
</a>
<br><br>

- **Zero setup** – just open the link in your browser
- **Perfect for evaluation** – see if the tool fits your needs before installing
- **Single flight visualization** – upload and analyze one flight log at a time
- **All core features** – view telemetry charts, 3D flight path replay, and flight statistics
- **No data persistence** – your data is processed locally in the browser and not stored on any server

> **Note:** For the full experience with multi-flight management, database persistence, filtering, overview analytics, and backup/restore capabilities, use the desktop app or self-hosted Docker deployment. 

### macOS Users: "Damaged File" Error Fix

<img width="320" height="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2787ffff-9961-433c-898a-b548c738f1a2" />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you see **"Drone Logbook is damaged and can't be opened"** on macOS, this is a Gatekeeper security warning for unsigned apps, **not a corrupted file**. Apple charges $99/year for developer signing, so we provide these free workarounds instead.

#### Method 1: Right-Click to Open

This is the simplest method and works for most users:

1. **Locate the app** in your Applications folder (or wherever you placed it after downloading)
2. **Right-click** (or Control+click) on "Drone Logbook.app"
3. **Select "Open"** from the context menu
4. **Click "Open"** in the dialog that appears

#### Method 2: Terminal Command

Open **Terminal** (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight) and run:

Simply type `xattr -cr ` (with a space at the end), then **drag and drop** the app onto the Terminal window - it will auto-fill the file path:

```bash
xattr -cr <delete-this-part-after-cr-and-drag-and-drop-the-app-here>
```

Then press Enter and try opening the app again.

## Usage

1. **Import a Flight Log**: Click "Browse Files" or drag-and-drop a drone log file
2. **Select a Flight**: Click on a flight in the sidebar
3. **Analyze Data**: View telemetry charts and the 3D flight path on the map
4. **Filter/Search/Sort**: Use date range, drone/device, battery serial filters, search, and sorting
5. **Overview Analytics**: Sidebar filters (date, drone, battery, duration) automatically apply to overview statistics
5. **Export**: Use the Export dropdown in the stats bar (CSV/JSON/GPX/KML)
6. **Backup & Restore**: Use Settings → Backup Database to export, or Import Backup to restore
7. **Configure Settings**: Set API key, theme, units, and view app data/log directories


## Building from source (Linux users)

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (1.70+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or npm


```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/drone-logbook
cd dji-logbook

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri
```

## Docker deployment (Self-hosted Web)

The app can also be deployed as a self-hosted web application using Docker. This uses an Axum REST backend instead of Tauri IPC, with Nginx serving the frontend and proxying API requests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Web interface is primarily designed for Desktop or larger screen viewing. Basic mobile responsiveness is available but the full experience is best on larger screens.

### Quick start (recommended)

Pull the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/arpanghosh8453/drone-logbook:latest

docker run -d \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v drone-data:/data/drone-logbook \
  --name drone-logbook \
  ghcr.io/arpanghosh8453/drone-logbook:latest
```

Or use docker-compose (uses the same pre-built image):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/drone-logbook
cd dji-logbook
docker compose up -d
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Building locally from source

If you want to build the Docker image from source instead of pulling the pre-built one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/drone-logbook
cd dji-logbook
docker compose -f docker-compose-build.yml up -d
```

> **Note:** The initial build takes ~10–15 minutes (Rust compilation). Subsequent rebuilds are much faster thanks to Docker layer caching.

### Data persistence

All flight data (DuckDB database, cached decryption keys) is stored in a Docker named volume (`drone-data`) mapped to `/data/drone-logbook` internally inside the container. Data persists across container restarts, image updates, and rebuilds. It is only removed if you explicitly delete the volume with `docker compose down -v`.

### Environment variables

| Variable        | Default                | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DATA_DIR`      | `/data/drone-logbook`  | Database and config storage                                                 |
| `RUST_LOG`      | `info`                 | Log level (debug, info, warn)                                               |
| `SYNC_LOGS_PATH`| (not set)              | Path to mounted folder for automatic log import (e.g., `/sync-logs`)        |
| `SYNC_INTERVAL` | (not set)              | Cron expression for scheduled sync (e.g., `0 0 */8 * * *` for every 8 hours)|

### Automatic log sync (Docker)

You can mount a folder containing your drone flight logs and have the app automatically import new files:

1. Uncomment the volume mount in `docker-compose.yml` and set the path to your logs folder:
   ```yaml
   - /path/to/your/drone/logs:/sync-logs:ro
   ```
2. Uncomment the `SYNC_LOGS_PATH` environment variable:
   ```yaml
   - SYNC_LOGS_PATH=/sync-logs
   ```
3. (Optional) Enable scheduled automatic sync by setting a cron expression:
   ```yaml
   - SYNC_INTERVAL=0 0 */8 * * *
   ```
4. Restart the container.

**Sync behavior:**
- Without `SYNC_INTERVAL`: Manual sync only - use the "Sync" button in the web interface to import new files
- With `SYNC_INTERVAL`: The server automatically syncs at the scheduled times, plus manual sync via the button

**Common cron expressions:**
| Expression | Schedule |
|------------|----------|
| `0 0 */8 * * *` | Every 8 hours |
| `0 0 0 * * *` | Daily at midnight |
| `0 0 */2 * * *` | Every 2 hours |
| `0 30 6 * * *` | Daily at 6:30 AM |
| `0 0 0 * * 0` | Weekly on Sunday at midnight |

The sync status and a manual "Sync" button will appear in the Import section when configured. During sync, the app shows file-by-file progress (current filename, X of Y counter) matching the desktop app experience.


## Configuration

- **DJI API Key**: Stored locally in `config.json`. You can also provide it via `.env` or via the `settings` menu inside the application. The standalone app ships with a default key, but users should enter their own to avoid rate limits for log file decryption key fetching.
- **Database Location**: Stored in the platform-specific app data directory (e.g., AppData on Windows, Application Support on macOS, and local share on Linux). In Docker mode, data is stored in `/data/drone-logbook` (persisted via a Docker volume).
- **Log Files**: App logs are written to the platform-specific log directory and surfaced in Settings. In Docker mode, logs are written to stdout.

## How to obtain your own DJI Developer API key

I have shipped this project with my own API key to save you from some extra painful steps. If you are tech savvy please read the following guide to generate and use your own API key for this project. To acquire an apiKey, follow these steps:

1. Visit [DJI Developer Technologies](https://developer.dji.com/user) and log in. Create an account if you don't have one, this is different registration than your existing DJI account, but you can login with your existing account as well. 
2. Fill out personal info (for those who value privacy, I’m not sure if it needs to be real info)
3. Click `CREATE APP`, choose `Open API` as the App Type, and provide the necessary details like `App Name`, `Category`, and `Description`.
4. After creating the app, activate it through the link sent to your email.
6. On your developer user page, find your app's details to retrieve the 31 character long alphanumeric ApiKey (labeled as the SDK key or APP key). Do not use the APP ID number, that is not your API key.
